# Feature List for first prototype #
_These are things without which it's pointless to consider it a working prototype_

  * Parsing written English into calendar events ([issue 1](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=1))
> > (including disambiguating dates using European/American standards)
  * Tagging (and smart tagging at that - @weekly, @monthly) ([issue 2](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=2))
  * Email reminders (on queue and daily digests) ([issue 3](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=3))
  * Reschedule/edit appointments and to-dos ([issue 4](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=4))
  * Recurring events ([issue 5](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=5))



# Production (beta) Version #
_These things are really nice but not killers for an alpha release_
  * Twitter/laconi.ca/identi.ca ([issue 6](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=6)) or just plain SMS support ([issue 7](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=7)) _I'd prefer this in the alpha but can understand if it needs to wait to beta. Anna_
  * Info attached to an event maybe just textbox to write unformated text in? step up to simplified wiki markup à lá googlecode?) ([issue 8](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=8))
  * Add events via XMPP messaging (ie. jabber, google talk, etc) ([issue 9](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=9))
  * Export to .ics (goodness for google calendar, ical, and all things compliant with RFC 2445) ([issue 10](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=10))


# Future Versions #
  * Multiple "personalities"(not just Sandy) ([issue 11](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=11))
  * Sending reminders to "friends" ([issue 12](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=12))
  * Support for non-English Languages ([issue 13](https://code.google.com/p/sandysback/issues/detail?id=13))
