=The Big Issues=

Here's a chart of the greatest concerns of Sandy's former user base:

http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=t:13,7,16,13,18&chs=400x100&chl=Natural%20Language|SMS|3rd%20Party%20Integration|Reminders|Misc&nonsense=s.png

*Reminders* are a big issue (recurring events, daily digests configurable to be sent days in advanced),  *3rd party* integration it mostly twitter, followed closely by google calendar, *SMS* is all about input and queries though that medium and finally *Natural Language* refers to the Assistant's ability to parse a common email.

The data was gathered through blog comments, Twits, IM's and email.

 I loved Sandy's realness--the way I could count on her to understand what I wanted, the charm with which she   wished me well each morning, the reliable reminders of the minutiae of each day and week. I know that's not very  technical, but it's what mattered most to me, and why Remember the Milk just isn't going to cut it for me. I really did want Sandy.
